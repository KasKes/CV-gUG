## Contributing Your Code

There are two main ways to contribute changes to this project:

#### Forking the Repository for Review (New Features & Non-Bug Fixes):

This approach is ideal for changes that introduce new features or require review from the website owner.

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Preview URL (Optional):** If helpful, set up a preview environment to showcase your changes before submitting a pull request.
3. **Fetch Latest Changes (Optional):** If some time has passed since forking, it's good practice to fetch any recent updates from the original repository before making your changes.
4. **Make Your Changes Locally:** Edit the code on your local copy of the forked repository.
5. **Frequent Commits with Clear Messages:** Regularly commit your changes with descriptive messages that explain what you've modified.
6. **Reference Issues (Optional):** If your changes relate to an existing issue, link to it in your commit messages for better tracking.

#### Cloning the original Repository for Quick Fixes (Bug Fixes & Minor Changes):

This is suitable for small modifications or bug fixes that don't require extensive review.

1. **Clone the Repository:** clone the original repository to your local machine.
2. **Make Your Changes Locally:** Edit the code directly on your local repo.
3. **Follow Steps 3-6 from the "Forking" section above.**

**Testing:**

- Thoroughly test your changes before pushing them to the remote `main` branch.

**Pushing Your Changes:**

1. **Direct Push (Main Branch):** If you're working directly on the original repository (`main` branch) and confident in your changes, you can push them directly to the remote `main` branch.
2. **Pull Request for Forked Repositories:** If you're working on a forked repository, make your changes locally and then create a pull request to propose them to the main repository of the original project.
